```

### 3. Open in Xcode

1. **Double-click** on `ocr-app/ocr-app/ocr-app.xcodeproj` to open the project in Xcode

2. The project structure will look like:
   ```
   ocr-app (project)
   â”œâ”€â”€ ocr-app (folder)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Views/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ OCRApp.swift
   â””â”€â”€ Assets.xcassets
   ```

### 4. Add Privacy Permissions

In Xcode:
1. Select the project in the navigator
2. Select the "ocr-app" target
3. Go to the "Info" tab
4. Add these keys under "Custom iOS Target Properties":
   - **Privacy - Camera Usage Description**: "We need access to your camera to capture photos of your handwritten notes and journals for OCR processing."
   - **Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description**: "We need access to your photo library to select images for OCR processing."

### 5. Build and Run

1. Select your target device (iPhone simulator or real device with iOS 17+)
2. Press **âŒ˜R** or click the Run button
3. Grant camera and photo library permissions when prompted

```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Capture Photos**
   - Tap "Take Photo" to use camera
   - Or "Choose from Library" to select existing photos
   - Take multiple photos (e.g., a week's worth of journal pages)

2. **Review Photos**
   - View all captured photos in a grid
   - Delete any unwanted photos
   - Add more photos if needed
   - Tap "Process" when ready

3. **OCR Processing**
   - App processes each photo with OCR
   - Extracts text from your handwriting
   - Suggests filenames based on content

4. **Edit & Review**
   - Review each page's extracted text
   - Edit filenames and text as needed
   - Delete any pages you don't want to save

5. **Export**
   - Choose format: Markdown or Plain Text
   - **Copy All**: Copy all pages to clipboard
   - **Save to Folder**: Select a folder (like your Obsidian vault)
   - **Share**: Use iOS share sheet for AirDrop, Messages, etc.

### Obsidian Workflow Example

1. Scan your week's journal pages (7 photos)
2. Process with OCR
3. Edit filenames to dates: "2025-10-16.md", "2025-10-17.md", etc.
4. Choose Markdown format
5. Save to your Obsidian vault folder
6. Each day becomes a separate note!

## Liquid Glass UI

This app showcases iOS 26's Liquid Glass design system:

- `.glassEffect()` modifiers for frosted glass backgrounds
- `.buttonStyle(.glass)` for glassmorphic buttons
- `Material.ultraThickMaterial` backgrounds
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent spacing and corner radii

## API Integration

The app uses the Nanonets OCR API:

- **Endpoint**: OCR2-3B model
- **Features**:
  - Handwriting recognition
  - Text extraction
  - Batch processing
- **Filename Detection**: Uses heuristics to extract titles from text (can be enhanced with LLM integration)

## Customization

### Adjust UI Constants

Edit `Models/Constants.swift` to customize:
- Corner radii
- Spacing
- Button sizes
- Glass effect parameters

### Improve Filename Detection

The current filename detection uses simple heuristics. To enhance:

1. Integrate with an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Update `NanonetsService.extractFilename()` to call the LLM
3. Provide a prompt like: "Extract a concise title from this text for use as a filename"

### Add More Export Formats

1. Add new case to `ExportFormat` enum
2. Implement format method
3. UI automatically updates

## Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working

- Check API key is correct in `NanonetsService.swift`
- Verify internet connection
- Check Nanonets account status and quota

### Camera Not Available

- Ensure Info.plist permissions are configured
- Check device camera permissions in Settings
- Test on physical device (simulator has limited camera)

### Files Not Saving

- Ensure you selected a valid folder
- Check app has file system permissions
- Try saving to iCloud Drive folder

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] On-device OCR for offline use
- [ ] Cloud sync for processed documents
- [ ] Multiple language support
- [ ] Auto-detect dates in handwriting
- [ ] Custom export templates
- [ ] Batch rename with patterns
- [ ] Integration with more note-taking apps
